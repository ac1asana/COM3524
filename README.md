## Windows Instructions

### 1. **Install Required Software**
- Install Docker Desktop and VcXsrv as mentioned [above](#Prerequisites)

After installing VcXsrv software, run the server (Xlaunch)
Set the default display settings as follow:
  - Multiple windows mode
  - Start no client

- This confirms that the X server is running in the background.

### 3. **Run the script**
Once you have made sure that the previous steps are done, you are ready to run the script:

```bash
.\windows.bat
```

>[!NOTE]
>Make sure that docker is running in the background 

## Linux (Ubuntu) Instructions

>[!NOTE]
>No additional configuration is typically required. Make sure you have Python and `pip` installed:
>run the command `python3 --version` or `pip --version` to check whether it is installed on your system

### 1. **Install Docker**

Follow Docker‚Äôs official guide:  
üëâ [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu)

### 2. **Set Up Repository and Test Docker**
```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

### 3. **Fix Permission Denied Errors (Optional)**  
If you encounter permission errors:  
[Fix Docker Permission Denied](https://hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-fix-docker-permission-denied-error)

### 4. **Run the following script**
```bash
./mac.sh 
```
---

## MacOS

Ensure Python 3 is installed (macOS may come with Python 2.x by default):

Switch to `zsh` if needed:
```bash
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

### 2. **Deactivate Conda (if active)**
```bash
conda deactivate
```

### 3. **Install and Launch XQuartz**

## Usage

After installation, run the main program with:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will display a menu or command-line interface for interacting with the available system tools.
